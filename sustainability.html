    <h2>Our Commitment to Sustainability</h2>

    <!-- Farm-to-Table Practices Section -->
    <section class="mission">
      <h3>Farm-to-Table Practices</h3>
      <p>Our farm-to-table approach emphasizes the importance of knowing exactly where our food comes from. We maintain close partnerships with local farmers who practice organic, regenerative, and biodiverse agriculture. This ensures fresher ingredients, reduced carbon emissions from transportation, and robust support for the local economy.</p>
      <p>We prioritize seasonal ingredients to work with nature's cycles, reducing resource use and waste. For example, summer blesses us with an abundance of tomatoes, squash, and herbs, while fall features hearty root vegetables and greens.</p>
      <p>Crop rotation and diligent soil health monitoring with our partner farms help sustain fertile, resilient farmland for future generations.</p>

    <!-- Preparation Processes & Waste Reduction Section -->
    <section class="mission">
      <h3>Preparation Processes & Waste Reduction</h3>
      <p>Within our kitchen, we focus on mindful preparation practices that maximize every ingredient’s value. Vegetable peels and scraps are composted or transformed into flavorful broths and sauces. Regular staff training on sustainable practices helps minimize water and energy usage.</p>
      <p>We use energy-efficient appliances and source renewable energy when possible. Eco-friendly products and biodegradable cleaning agents further reduce our environmental impact.</p>
      <p>Our dedication extends to reducing single-use plastics and actively engaging in community recycling initiatives.</p>

    <!-- Packaging and Operations Section -->
    <section class="mission">
      <h3>Packaging and Operations</h3>
      <p>All our take-out packaging is compostable or recyclable. We avoid plastic straws, utensils, and bags, instead offering biodegradable alternatives. Customers who bring their own containers even receive special discounts to encourage zero-waste practices.</p>
      <p>The design of our restaurant uses natural lighting and sustainable materials—such as reclaimed wood and low-VOC paints—to create an ambience that is both welcoming and kind to the planet.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Renewable Energy & Innovations Section -->
    <section class="innovation">
      <h3>Renewable Energy & Eco-Friendly Innovations</h3>
      <p>Beyond sourcing and kitchen practices, we actively invest in renewable energy projects on-site. Solar panels and wind energy systems reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources, and innovative water recycling systems assist in conserving our valuable water supply.</p>

    <section class="impact-stats">
      <h3>Environmental Impact in Numbers</h3>
      <p>Since opening our doors, we have reduced carbon emissions by over 40%, decreased water usage by 30%, and diverted more than 5000 pounds of waste from landfills. We continue to explore innovative methods to ensure each meal contributes to a healthier, greener planet.</p>
