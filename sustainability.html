    <h2>Our Commitment to Sustainability</h2>

    <section class="mission">
      <h3>Farm-to-Table Practices</h3>
      <p>Our farm-to-table approach emphasizes the importance of knowing exactly where our food comes from. We maintain close partnerships with local farmers who use organic, regenerative, and biodiverse agricultural practices. This approach ensures fresher ingredients, reduces carbon emissions from transportation, and supports the local economy.</p>
      <p>We prioritize seasonal ingredients to work with nature's cycles, which reduces resource use and waste. For example, in summer, expect plenty of fresh tomatoes, squash, and herbs; in fall, hearty root vegetables and greens take center stage.</p>
      <p>Additionally, we engage in crop rotation and soil health monitoring with our farmers to help maintain fertile, resilient farmland for future generations.</p>

      <h3>Preparation Processes & Waste Reduction</h3>
      <p>In the kitchen, we focus on mindful preparation to maximize every ingredient’s value. Vegetable peels and scraps are composted or repurposed into broths and sauces. Our team trains regularly on sustainable kitchen practices to minimize water and energy use.</p>
      <p>We use energy-efficient appliances and source renewable energy where possible. Our cleaning products are eco-friendly and biodegradable, reducing chemical impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>Our staff members are encouraged to reduce single-use plastics and participate in local environmental initiatives.</p>

      <h3>Packaging and Operations</h3>
      <p>All packaging for take-out orders is compostable or recyclable. We avoid plastic straws, utensils, and bags, offering biodegradable alternatives instead. Customers who bring their own containers receive special discounts to encourage zero-waste habits.</p>
      <p>Our restaurant design uses natural lighting and sustainable materials such as reclaimed wood and low-VOC paints to reduce environmental impact and create a welcoming, natural ambiance.</p>

      <h3>Join Us in Creating a Greener Future</h3>

      <p>Together, we can build a healthier planet—one meal at a time.</p>
