      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Founded in 2020 by a group of passionate vegetarians and sustainability advocates, Verdant Kitchen began as a vision to bring wholesome, ethical dining to our community. With backgrounds in culinary arts, agriculture, and environmental science, our team combines expertise to create an unparalleled dining experience.</p>
      <p>From humble beginnings, our commitment to local sourcing and sustainable operations has allowed us to grow into a beloved community hub where food lovers gather to celebrate plant-based cuisine.</p>

      <h3>Farm-to-Table Philosophy</h3>
      <p>We proudly source our ingredients from farms within a 100-mile radius that prioritize regenerative farming techniques—practices designed to restore soil health, increase biodiversity, and sequester carbon. Our seasonal menus reflect what is fresh and abundant, reducing reliance on imports and minimizing environmental impact.</p>
      <p>Working closely with farmers allows us to understand the journey of our food from the soil to your plate, ensuring transparency and quality at every step. We support heirloom and indigenous crop varieties to promote agricultural diversity.</p>
      <p>Our relationship with local producers is built on respect and shared values of stewardship, community, and excellence.</p>

      <h3>Our Preparation Process</h3>
      <p>Every dish at Verdant Kitchen is handcrafted by our culinary team with attention to detail and reverence for ingredients. We use time-honored techniques like slow roasting, fermentation, and cold-pressing to unlock flavors and enhance nutrition.</p>
      <p>Our kitchen operates with a zero-waste mindset: vegetable scraps become broths and stocks, composting keeps organic matter out of landfills, and we avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.</p>
      <p>Preparation emphasizes freshness and minimal processing—washing, chopping, and cooking happen daily to preserve vitamins, minerals, and natural textures.</p>
      <p>We incorporate modern innovations alongside traditional methods, like sous-vide for precision cooking, and raw food preparations that retain maximum enzymes.</p>
